Gateguard

Scripts to automate iptable management. 
So far works for ipv4, with ipv6 coming as soon as I have time. :)

To use:
Give executable permissions to all of the files. 
(They're all shell code, so feel free to check them out)

Gateguard uses the other files depending on the commands you pass in.
Soft link into /usr/bin if you want to be able to use it anywhere. 

Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
